2. Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
---
A license preserves the rights and freedoms of all interested in the project. 
You can run the program for any purpose, study the program as desired,
redestribute copies, and make changes and distribute your modifications.
Acknowledges the contributions of the author and others involved.


3. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
---
If you take part in a project that does not have an explicit license,
you may find the policy of the program changes in unecpected ways. This
may make the project non-viable for your use, and thus wastes all time 
and contributions you put forward towards it.


4. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher.
---
The open systems approach to the development of the internet made it quickly outpace
the progress by the Gopher team. When many people use and have access to change the 
tool they utilzise, they will do their best to improve the tool however possible.
This means that the web development team was capable of making changes to protocol,
server software and other sections at a far greter and more reliable fashion than Gopher.
So I agree with the claim that it was a failure to not utilzise the open systems model.


5. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? 
---
If you are a for profit company that seeks to maintain their internal autonomy as well as preserve
the assets for company personal projects, it makes sense to utilize a closed source license. SailfishOS
wants control over the production and distribution of their OS, as such they need a closed source license.


6. Think of an example project for your Table. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github.
---
Table's example project: 
Web Edit. Allows you to easily edit webpages locally and retain a copy with your edits. Example usage would 
be to highlight text in an article, or to easily mockup website design changes for the website's designer to 
use as feedback. If the webpage is updated, a diff can be run between your original local version and the new
version, and you can decide from there how to merge them. )
License:
LGPL


7. Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better
---
Under the LGPL license, derivatives works can only be redistributed under LGPL, but applications that use the
library don't have to be. This is useful for a company that wants their software to be maintained and improved,
but still wants proprietary ownership over parts of their program. Under the GPL license, all changes to the
code must be made available, as well as relatively easy to build and install. As such, the GPL license is best
for the greater good, as every improvement will be public to use. The Apache license is best for developers as
their work under the license is patented and valid to use for commericial use. This allows their work to be
protected and profitable.


8. Create a repository and choose a license.

9.Write five sentences about choosing a project to work on in this course.
---
I would want to work on a project that benefits the RPI community. The users would be
RPI students, and potentially RPI staff or community members. Since the goal of such
a project would be to create a sustainable and replicable program, I would likely use 
the GPL license. This ensures that any contributions and distributions will be for the 
benefit of all members of the community.


10. Take 5 projects from Observatory or past RCOS Projects and create a table for which project has which license.
---

Website | License Present | License
---------|:----------|:-------
