 1. Create a project page in http://rcos.io and include your team members
 
 https://rcos.io/projects/schedj/schedj-frontend/profile
 
 
 2. Create a Mattermost channel for your project or join an existing RCOS Mattermost channel if you are doing an RCOS project.
 
 https://chat.rcos.io/rcos/channels/schedj
 
 
 3. The categories below what we will be evaluating and the types of activities that contribute to the category. Not all of the types of
 contribution are required for every project, but make sure you have enough separate contributions to demonstrate your understanding of
 open source development and good project design. Items like documentation and code contrbutions, for example, are both ways of making
 contributions to the project. If you write 300 pages of documentation, I would not expect many code contributions.
 
 
 
 
 4. Some of the project structure items will be weighed differently depending on if you are joining an established project or creating your own. If you are joining an existing project,
 be able to find the items and know what the items say. If you see holes that are needed for effective project management,
 you can create them locally and then engage with the community to see if they would want to adopt your contribution.
 However, choosing, for example, a project without a license will result in a substantial deduction to your grade.
 
 
 
 
 3. Please note that you will need to demonstrate or document how you meet these rubric items.

Test infrastructure: We engaged in testing installing and running the program on multiple machines to
varrying degrees of effectiveness. To allow others to test, I created an installation Guide for Ubuntu/Linux systems.

# CONTRIBUTIONS

Contributions currently in a pull request.
Mostly QOL changes, the project missed a lot of "Project Structure" files.
Created the following files:
 - Code of Conduct.md
 - Get_Involved.md 
 - How_To_Contribute.md
 - Style_Guidelines.md
 - Ubuntu_Installation_Guide.md
 
Most notable contrbution: Ubuntu_Installation_Guide.md
I created a Ubuntu persistent-boot drive allowing me save changes between ubuntu boots
to test the program and pull updates onto a convenient portable os.
This allowed me to fill in a gap in installation documentation.
As we stressed in the presentation, all 4 of us had trouble installing and running the project.
If any new contributors sought to join without contacting the team, they would likely get
frustrated at the lack of instruction. As I stressed in the Style Guidelines, clarity and ease
of use are key parts of a healthy project.

	So far noone has had any luck installing the back-end or the front-end. The project has poor
	documentation for installation, any instructions in the readme seem to not produce the result
	it implies it would. The project lead assured it would work, but his instructions did not result
	for anyone following them. Without this done, testing if the app works at all is impossible.
	Clear and concise documentation is a must.

	I worked with professor Turner to create an Ubuntu peristent-boot drive for testing purposes.
	We ran into a couple snags along the way, but in the end it was sorted out and I was able to
	access and download the gihub repos. 
	After some finagling I was able to install all the dependencies, and start up the backend server,
	and the frontend packager. With this complete, I opened up the expo app on my android device.
	The app is unfinished, but all functionality seen to work on an ios device was shown to work perfectly
	on android as well. All the steps I took from a fresh boot of linux, to running the app are documented
	in the Ubuntu_Installation_Guide.md.
	
# WEEK of 4/15/19
	Did some documentation, spoke to the project lead about plans for the future. He suggested I present
	schedj at RCOS in the fall of next semester, and perhaps during the summer, as he will be on coop during
	this time. I will try to do so to my best abilities.
